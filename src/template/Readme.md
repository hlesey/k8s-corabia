# Generate template box

In order to build a new template you need a vagrant cloud token that can be
acquired from `https://app.vagrantup.com/settings/security` Make sure you have
`packer` and `vagrant` installed (for MacOS `brew install packer vagrant`)

To build and upload a new `hlesey/k8s-base` vagrant box run

```bash
VAGRANT_CLOUD_TOKEN=<token> VERSION=<box_version> make box
```

Be aware that if the version already exists in vagrant cloud you will get an
error. This should be solved after
[https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/issues/9492](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/issues/9492)
will be implemented. One way to mitigate it is to manually remove the provider
for this version from Vagrant Cloud UI and retry the above make command.
