# Prerequisites

The cluster will be provisioned in the cloud and you need to
setup your local machine to connect to it.

### 1. You must have *admin privileges* on your local machine/laptop

### 2. Download and install (with default settings) the following software (64bit version)

* MacOS:
  * [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* Windows:
  * [git bash v2.43.0](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.43.0.windows.1/Git-2.43.0-64-bit.exe)
  * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* Linux:
  * [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### 3. On your Desktop, create a folder with the name `labs` and change the current directory to `labs` folder

* MacOS/Linux:
  * `cd $HOME/Desktop`
  * `mkdir labs`
  * `cd labs`
* Windows:
  * open `git-bash` app and run the following commands
  * `cd $HOME/Desktop`
  * `mkdir labs`
  * `cd labs`
* Linux:
  * `cd $HOME/Desktop`
  * `mkdir labs`
  * `cd labs`

### 4. Deactivate `autocrlf` for git

* `git config --global core.autocrlf false`

### 5. Clone the following git repositories in your `labs` folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hlesey/k8s-corabia.git
git clone https://github.com/hlesey/k8s-labs.git
git clone https://github.com/hlesey/phippy.git
```

### 6. Configure `kubectl` command line tool

The following script needs to be executed from `labs` folder: `./k8s-corabia/src/utils/tools/configure-kubectl.sh`

After that, run the following command to load the new shell configuration:

* MacOS:
  * `source ~/.bash_profile`
* Windows:
  * `source ~/.bash_profile`
* Linux:
  * `source ~/.bashrc`

### 7. You need internet connectivity and *be able to access the internet on the following ports*

* TCP/30080
* TCP/30443
* TCP/300XX ( where XX represents your birth day :) )
* TCP/6443
* TCP/22

You can use `http://portquiz.net:<port number>` for testing the connectivity.

Example: <http://portquiz.net:30080> tests if 30080/TCP port is opened for egress.
To verify, open the link in your browser and check if the page is displayed.

Another way to verify via the command line by executing:

```bash
‚ùØ curl http://portquiz.net:30080
Port 30080 test successful!
Your IP: 188.25.190.205
```

Do the same for the remaining ports from the above mentioned ports list.

### 8. If everything went smooth, you should be ready for the trip :)
